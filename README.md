# Don't Budge

A lightweight budgeting app created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Allows users to enter their budget and expenses and calculate their remaining budget balance based upon these inputs.

Forms are validated by checking for numbers or empty strings before values can be submitted.

Entering a new budget overwrites the previous value and returns new calculations based upon the new input.

Expenses are displayed on screen and can easily be removed from display and calculation by clicking the "delete" button.
